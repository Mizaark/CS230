## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client in this project was The Gaming Room. They had an application called Draw It or Lost It for Android that they wanted to port to other operating systems in order to expand their client base.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel that I was able to keep the document clear and consice.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped in keeping me focused on the task on hand and to decide on what tasks were important to focus on.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could change one thing it would be the Recommendations section. I felt like I explained everyhting sufficiently, however I would like to go back and explain even more thoroughly.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By taking the functionality of the game and splitting it up, it allows for more time focusing on the expansion to other operating platforms. The client may be who you are working for at the moment, however if the user doesn't like the end product the client won't come back again. That's why it is crucial to keep the user's needs in mind when you are designing.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it by taking the requirement provided by the client and attempted to translate those into actionable aspects. This allowed me to break up the design into sections that could be focused on independently. This method worked well for me so I don't forsee myself making any adjustments to the technique in the forseeable future.
